                Cinematography has always been more than just capturing moving images for me — it's about telling stories that words sometimes fail to express. My journey into this art form started with a simple curiosity: how can a camera capture not just what we see, but what we feel?

It began with experimenting — filming everyday moments, learning how light dances across faces, and how framing can shift the entire mood of a scene. Every shot taught me something new about patience, observation, and the power of perspective. I spent countless hours studying the works of great filmmakers, analyzing how they used color, movement, and silence to breathe life into their stories.

Over time, what started as a hobby grew into a passion. I invested in my skills — learning about lenses, lighting, editing, and the delicate balance between technical precision and creative instinct. Every project, whether big or small, became an opportunity to refine my craft and push boundaries.

Today, cinematography is not just what I do — it's a part of who I am. It's the lens through which I see the world: full of emotion, possibility, and stories waiting to be told.

This is just the beginning, and I'm excited to continue growing, creating, and capturing moments that inspire.
